# Otto DIY+ (PLUS)
"Otto DIY with steroids" 

This Repository have all open source files for Otto DIY+ an interactive robot that anyone can make!,
Otto DIY + can make everything that Otto DIY does + Bluetooth + APP + switch + sensors + strength +... anything you might expand feel FREE to add and contribute.

Is completely open source, Arduino compatible, 3D printable, once you have all components and tools you will be able to build your own Otto

This is a more advanced version requires some expertise and patience, if you want to start slow as a beginner, please go to [Basic Otto DIY in Wikifactory](https://wikifactory.com/+OttoDIY/otto-diy) 

We decided to leave github for the main codes and more advanced coders. For the latest changes please go and join our [Otto DIY+ in Wikifactory](https://wikifactory.com/+OttoDIY/otto-diy-plus) is a similar platform but much more easy to use, visual and simple for all the community to collaborate.

Start by [downloading all files here](https://github.com/OttoDIY/PLUS/archive/master.zip)

## 1. Interact with other Otto builders
Join the [Otto builders group in facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ottodiy/)

## 2. Buy to build or make your own Otto!
Difficult to find all the parts?, please support Otto DIY and open-source hardware by purchasing kits from (http://ottodiy.com), is a way to contribute and support this project to continue growing, Otto DIY invests time and resources providing this open source code, 
so with your help we can continue offering very affordable kits and constantly creating new robots open for all.

After you have all components just follow the instruction manual in the files and build your own Otto in one hour!

If you want make Otto all by yourself ;) that is great too! but do not forget to add your [marker in our google map!](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qXEfuS5egbF14gi8EUjJ6U-dITHoJJNZ&usp=sharing)

## 3. Share your innovative creation with #OttoDIY
A redesign, modified code or if your creation is different but inspired in Otto; is technically a remix, so please share in our [Wikifactory Social & Design Platform](https://wikifactory.com/+OttoDIY) or please post that you have [made/remix an Otto in Thingiverse and add to this group](https://www.thingiverse.com/groups/ottodiy) or pull a request here in Github!

Keep sharing with us in any social media, tag friends, family with #OttoDIY and make sure more robot fans do the same everywhere, we love to see Otto robots around the world!

Please help us to spread out the word first in Maker Faires, Maker spaces, Hacker spaces, Schools, Universities, tech events and so on...

## 4. Otto DIY robot for STEAM education 
Educational deep content for STEAM centers, we already partner with many tech companies, entrepreneurs, educational centers and schools around the world, just contact us to be an official collaborator, we easily adapt to different curriculum or needs and we can leverage your ideas too!

Add your [organization in our google map](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qXEfuS5egbF14gi8EUjJ6U-dITHoJJNZ&usp=sharing) and do not hesitate to contact us

## For the quick start programming and learners
1. Download mBlock.cc Version 3; is an opensource software for easy programming Robot by Drop and Drag blocks. Based on Scratch 2.0 (MIT), beside sharing the great feature of graphical coding of Scratch, mBlock also integrates an Arduino Code generator for upload program into any Arduino based Hardware.
2. Add the Otto DIY Extension in mBlock software, swtich in the menu to Arduino mode
3. Drag and drop functions, dance, sounds and conditionals from robot Otto blocks
4. Connect, select Arduino Nano 328 and check the USB COM port
5. Upload your own code and Otto will follow each block command.

Alternatively you can use [Arduino Blocks (based on Google Blocly)](http://www.arduinoblocks.com/web/project/20999) and [Kittenblock (based on Scratch 3.0)](https://kittenbot-docs-en.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kittenbot/02InstallKittenblock.html) 

## For the advanced programmer
1. Download & Install Arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software also this driver if you have a clone board: http://www.wch.cn/download/CH341SER_EXE.html for PC, or http://www.wch.cn/download/CH341SER_MAC_ZIP.html for MAC
2. Copy all libraries to C:\Users\user\Documents\Arduino\libraries (or wherever your library folder is installed):
3. Open  any .ino code, make sure in tools you have "Board: Arduino Nano" "Processor ATmega328" and your Otto is connected to the corresponding port
4. Upload the APP code to Otto DIY+
5. Download and install the  APP
6. Share in our Otto builder Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/ottodiy/groups/

### Otto was Design using Tinkercad!
[You can modify it for customization](https://www.tinkercad.com/users/h8O1zJQboeH-camilo-parra-palacio) or further improvements!

### Otto DIY+ is  design using Autodesk Fusion 360
So is completely parametric and precise to adjust tolerances
[You can modify it for customization](https://gallery.autodesk.com/fusion360/projects/otto-diyplus) or further improvements

### Hall of fame Otto builders list
Otto was inspired by another robot BoB the BiPed and programmed using code from [biped robot Zowi](https://github.com/bqlabs/zowi)
Otto's differences are in the size being smaller, easy to build, cleaner integration of component and most importantly easy to replicate so that more people is empower to make robots anywhere in the world. 

Our broad community is awesome! we have been developing and improving OttoDIY project together ;)
